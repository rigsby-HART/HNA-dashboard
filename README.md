# Housing Assessment Resource Tools (HART) Dashboard

## Introduction

A census-based tool that measures core housing need and affordable shelter costs by income category, household size, and priority populations. Our methods allow governments to set effective housing targets that will lift Canadians out of chronic housing need and homelessness.

The tool is powered by census data custom built by Statistics Canada in collaboration with HART researchers.

The HART tool and dashboard includes data for Canada; the Provinces and Territories; Census divisions (CD), a general term for regional planning areas; and Census subdivisions (CSD), a general term for municipalities.  

The dashboard was created in collaboration with [Licker Geospatial](https://www.lgeo.co/), who can be reached for further questions regarding dashboard functionality and design.
