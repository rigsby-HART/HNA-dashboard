This is all legacy code which does not work leftover from the original code handover from Licker Geospatial.

I am writing this as Jack, the developer who started working on this from October 2023, and can only infer that they 
thought that we wouldn't need the ability to convert the original spreadsheets into the db files, but am unsure to why
they had left the code unfinished.  As such, I have left these here as reference code, as they do have useful 
information, but do not work to generate any datasets (at least with any of the spreadsheets I was given).
